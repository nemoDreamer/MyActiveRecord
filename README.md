MyActiveRecord
==============

Unofficial git repo of Jake Grimley's MyActiveRecord class.

## Note:

Since I forked this, someone created an "official" fork w/ Jake's blessing,
and has fixed some of the bugs I'd already fixed here.

See https://github.com/walterdavis/myactiverecord for that more up-to-date
code, now at version 0.6!
